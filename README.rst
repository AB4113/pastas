PASTA Introduction
======================
PASTA is an open source python package for simulating time series in the
field of
hydrology. The object oriented stucture allows for the quick implementation of new
model components. Time series models can be created, calibrated, and analysed with
just a few lines of python code with the built-in optimization, visualisation, and
statistical analysis tools.

If you think you have found a bug in PASTA, or if you would like to suggest an
improvement or enhancement, please submit a new Issue through the Github Issue
tracker toward the upper-right corner of the Github repository. Pull requests will
only be accepted on the development branch (dev) of the repository.
