Documenting Pastas Code
=======================

When submitting a new function, method or class, docstrings are required
before the new code will be pulled into the dev branch. Documentation is
created using `Sphinxdoc <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_. Docstrings within
the method or class need to be written in `NumPy docformat
<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_ to
enable automatic documentation on this website. A Jupyter Notebook explaining the
use of your new code can be added the to examples folder. This Notebook will also
be automatically converted and placed on the Examples page on this website.
